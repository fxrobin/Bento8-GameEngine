; This data determines how the level blocks will be constructed graphically. There are
; two kinds of block mappings: 16x16 and 128x128.
;
; 16x16 blocks are made up of four cells arranged in a square (thus, 16x16 pixels).
; Two bytes are used to define each cell, so the block is 8 bytes long. It can be
; represented by the bitmap blockMapElement, of which the members are:
;
; unk
;  These bits have to do with pattern orientation. I do not know their exact
;  meaning.
; patternIndex
;  The pattern's address divided by $20. Otherwise said: an index into the
;  pattern array.
;
; Each mapping can be expressed as an array of four blockMapElements, while the
; whole table is expressed as a two-dimensional array of blockMapElements (blockMapTable).
; The maps are read in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.
;
; 128x128 maps are basically lists of indices into blockMapTable. The levels are built
; out of these "big blocks", rather than the "small" 16x16 blocks. bigBlockMapTable is,
; predictably, the table of big block mappings.
; Each big block is 8 16x16 blocks, or 16 cells, square. This produces a total of 16
; blocks or 64 cells.
; As noted earlier, each element of the table provides 'i' for blockMapTable[i][j].
